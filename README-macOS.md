# Moaz Downloader for macOS

Thank you for using Moaz Downloader! This guide will help you get the application running on your Mac.

## How to Run

1.  **Unzip the File:**
    After downloading `macOS.zip`, double-click it to extract a folder containing the application (`MoazDownloader.app`) and this guide.

2.  **Move the Application:**
    Drag the `MoazDownloader.app` application icon from this folder into your main **`Applications`** folder. This is the standard and recommended location.

3.  **First-Time Launch:**
    Because this application is not from the Mac App Store, you must follow these steps the very first time you open it:
    *   Go to your **`Applications`** folder.
    *   **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `MoazDownloader` application icon.
    *   Select **"Open"** from the context menu.
    *   A warning dialog will appear. Click the **"Open"** button to confirm you want to run the application.

    You only need to do this once. Afterwards, you can launch the app normally from your Applications folder.

## System Requirements
*   macOS 10.10 or later.
*   No external dependencies are required.

## Troubleshooting
If you double-click the application and see a message that says **"MoazDownloader can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer,"** it means the security check needs to be bypassed. Please follow these steps:

1.  **Right-click** (or Control-click) the `MoazDownloader` application in your `Applications` folder.
2.  Select **"Open"** from the menu that appears.
3.  A final warning dialog will pop up. Click the **"Open"** button to confirm.

You only need to do this the very first time you run the application. After this, you can open it normally.
